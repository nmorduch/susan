title: About Me
---

My passion is learning.  It started as an undergraduate, studying cognitive science at Brown University, trying to understand how people learn â€“ exploring memory, language and making connections. 

In graduate school (PhD in School Psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University, 1998) I studied blocks to learning, adding nature and nurture to the mix. I also developed an interest in early childhood and parenting. This led to my doctoral internship at the Early Childhood Center and Infant and Preschool Unit of CERC, part of the Rose F. Kennedy Center at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

When I put this understanding of learning into practice, I saw that life makes diagnoses and remediation complicated, to say the least. I became increasingly interested in other types of learning beyond the scope of formal education, transitioning from academic to emotional learning.  

People are learning and adapting throughout their lives, and often need different coping skills as new circumstances arise.  These new challenges can exacerbate anxiety and depression, often blocking people from moving forward.  I find that cognitive behavioral therapy helps people most directly in changing their ways of thinking and doing, which leads to greater contentment and a more fulfilling life.
