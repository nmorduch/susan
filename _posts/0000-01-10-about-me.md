My passion is learning.  It started as an undergraduate, studying cognitive science at Brown University, trying to understand how people learn – exploring memory, language and making connections. 

In graduate school (PhD in School Psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University, 1998), I studied development, and ways to assess and encourage learning. I also developed an interest in early childhood and parenting. This led to my doctoral internship at the Early Childhood Center and Infant and Preschool Unit of CERC, part of the Rose F. Kennedy Center at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

When I put this understanding of learning into practice, I became even more aware of life's complexities. I became increasingly interested in other types of learning beyond the scope of formal education, transitioning from academic to emotional learning.
