I am currently a provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance. 

I am also an out-of-network provider and provide services to the uninsured. The fee for an initial interview (60 minutes) is $225 and ongoing psychotherapy sessions (45 minutes) are $175 each. I also use a sliding scale, if necessary. 

Co-payment or payment is accepted by cash or check, at the beginning of our session. Psychotherapy is an allowable expense for your Health Spending or Flexible Spending Account.
