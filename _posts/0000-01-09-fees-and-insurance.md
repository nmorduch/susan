I no longer provide services with insurance companies as an in-network provider. However, I am an out-of-network provider and can help submit paperwork on your behalf. I also provide services to the under-insured with a sliding scale, if necessary. 

Co-payment or payment is accepted by cash, credit or check, at the beginning of our session. Psychotherapy is an allowable expense for your Health Spending or Flexible Spending Account.
