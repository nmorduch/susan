I am an in-network provider for Blue Cross Blue Shield and Beacon Health insurances. 

I am also an out-of-network provider for other insurances and provide services to the under-insured with a sliding scale, if necessary. 

Co-payment or payment is accepted by cash, credit or check, at the beginning of our session. Psychotherapy is an allowable expense for your Health Spending or Flexible Spending Account.
