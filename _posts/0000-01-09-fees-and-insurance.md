title: Fees and Insurance
---

I currently accept Cigna and Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance. 

I am also an out-of-network provider. The fee for an initial interview (60 minutes) is $200 and ongoing psychotherapy sessions (45-minutes) are $150 each. I will use a sliding scale, if necessary. 

Co-payment or payment is accepted by cash or check, at the beginning of our session. Psychotherapy is an allowable expense for your Health Spending or Flexible Spending Accounts.
