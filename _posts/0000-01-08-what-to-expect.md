### Children and Adolescents

As your child and I get to know one another, we will find the best ways for them to open up and work on the issues that are of concern.  Sometimes children are more comfortable having direct conversations about their feelings and concerns, but, most often, younger children’s thoughts and feelings are best revealed and worked out through play.

I prefer to keep sessions, particularly with teens, confidential to help build trust -- an essential ingredient in successful therapy. There are times this is not possible, such as if there is risk of personal harm. Parents like to, and should be, informed of progress, however. All children I see will also have occasional family sessions. Parents are a vital part of a child’s life and thus can play a significant role in psychotherapy. Young children, in particular, benefit from a greater and active parental role in therapy. The information shared at family sessions will be discussed with the children prior to these meetings, to ensure that their trust is maintained.

### Adults

I mostly use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with aspects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness in our work together ([see descriptions here](/resources#typesOfPsychotherapy)). I will work with you collaboratively to better understand the relationship between your thoughts and behaviors, and how this relates to the way you feel. This may require homework or practice on your part, to make sure we get the most benefit from our time together.
